 git show <commit id> : To show details what commit has been done to code base

 git remote add origin <git url> :  To add local repository to remote repo

 --> git remote add origin https://github.com/ashish0920/testrepo.git

 git branch -M main  :  To create branch if it is a new repositroy

 git push -u origin main : Whatever origin we will add it will push the code from local repo to that remote repo

 git pull origin main : To pull code from repo

 git remote set-url : For changing your remote URL 

 git merge origin/main  : To merge the fetched changes into your branch

 git rebase origin/main : To incorporate the fetched changes by applying your local commits on top of the updated main branch, you can use rebase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To ignore the files while commiting name a file define all the files format you don't want to be get committed.
 create a file and define all the format in that file you want to ignore 
 > vim .gitignore
   *.java
   *.css
   ~
   ~
   :wq
 > git add .gitgnore
 > git commit -m "ignore file formats in this file"
 > git push 
 All the files will be pushed to remote repo except the format mentioned in this (.gitignore) file

 * ctrl+L : to clear screen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Untill we add files from working area to staging area we will be able to see that file from all branches once we add that to staging area of any particular branch we will not see it in any other branch.
 
 git branch :  To see list of available branches (* Represent the current branch you are working on)

 git branch <branch name> :  To create a new branch
 
 --> Whenever we create a branch all data which is there in main branch will get copied to it's feature branch just do "ls" to check after you checkout to feature branch
 
 git checkout <name of branch you want to switch> :  To switch branch

 * Merge : We use pulling mechanism to merge branches (Ex > (why) If we have created a feature branch and worked on it now we want to add that to main branch we will just pull the new files/code from feature branch not the complete files as while creating branch we have already copied everthing from main branch to feature branch)
  
 git merge <branch name> : When we want to merge any feature branch to main branch/another feature branch just go to the branch where where you want the feature branch to get merged then execute this command.
 
 * If you want any feature branch to get pushed to central repo after doing commit execute (below cmd) then it will show pull request url open that in browser merge it from browser.(*doubt) 
 
 git push --set-upstream origin <featured branch name> : To push featured branch to central repo 

 * Git conflict : When same name file have different content in different branches and you do merge resolve conflict then add/commi.
 
 * Git stashing : When we have a requirement where we have to clean our working area for some other code and we want that we can continue with the current code after sometime. We can put the current work to stashing area. Later when required we can start  working on it again.
 
 git stash : To stash an item
 
 git stash list : To see the list of stashed items

 git stash apply stash {Number of file} : To get file from stashed area to working area (It will copy/paste)

 git stash clear :  To clear the stash item from the stashed area after we added and commited that file and it's not required to be saved.

 git reset <filename>: If we have added the file to staging area and now we don't want to commit it for a single file. Once executed that file will not appear again in working directory.
 
 git reset. : Same as above but for all files. (Done on private file)

 git reset -- hard : To remove the file from both staging area and working area in once command.

 * Git revert : Helps to undo an existing commit.(Done on public file) It does not delete any data in this process instead. Rather git creates a new commit with the included files reverted to their pervious state. So your version control history moves forward while the state of your files moves backward.

 git revert <commit id> : To skip that particular commit. -->> Once executed add a message why to skip this commit then save.

 git clean -n(dry run) / -f(forcefully) : To remove untracked files it will delete the files which we don't want to commit or not added to staging area.

 * Tag : Tag operation allows giving meaninful names to specific version in the repository

 git tag -a <tagname> -m <message> <commit-id> : To apply tag

 git tag :  To show all tags

 git show <tag name/commit-id> : To see particular commit content by using tag

 git tag -d <tag name> : To delete a tag

 * Github clone: The repo which is already there in central repo will get copied to your local repo with same content and name.

 git clone <url> : To clone repo to local machine
